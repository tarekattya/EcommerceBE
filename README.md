## Overview

**EcommerceBE** is a backend application for an e-commerce platform, developed using **.NET 9 / C#** following **Clean Architecture** principles.
It provides a scalable and maintainable backend structure, supporting **product management, brand & category CRUD operations, account & user management, and cart functionality**.
The project is designed for future expansion to handle **orders, checkout, and payment integration**.

## Technologies & Tools

* **.NET 9**
* **C#**
* **Entity Framework Core (Code-First Approach)**
* **Clean Architecture** (Domain, Application, Infrastructure, API layers + Shared layer)
* **Mapster** for DTO and Entity mapping
* **Redis** for cart management
* **JWT Authentication & Identity** (planned for authentication and role management)

> Note: The **Shared layer** contains reusable components, DTOs, helpers, and abstractions used across all layers.

---

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tarekattya/EcommerceBE.git
```

2. Open the **.sln file** in **Visual Studio 2022+** or **VS Code**

3. Apply migrations (from solution root / Infrastructure layer detected automatically):

```bash
dotnet ef database update
```

4. Run the API project (`Ecommerce.API`)

5. Access endpoints via **Postman** or **Swagger UI**

---

## Notes

* Ensure **Redis** is running for cart management
* Mapster configuration must be registered in **Program.cs**
* Default values for pagination are set inside **ProductSpecParams** to handle missing query parameters
* Shared layer contains **reusable DTOs and helper methods**
